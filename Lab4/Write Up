Here is the sample size of my program.  In my program, I implemented the FIFO page
replacement by going through and checking for one of 3 situations:
1) Is the queue_length < cache_size and is queue_find() NULL
2) Is queue_find() not NULL
3) Has the queue_length() reached the same size as the cache_size

Using this, I was able to implement my FIFO replacement algorithm. However, there
was one issue that I was running into and it was in regards to my page reads. It
seems as though my page reads were well over the length of the actual text document
size. Which begs the question, should this be a static variable? Should our page reads ever
reach sizes that are greater than the length of the file that we are reading from?
On a different note, as we increase our sample size (referencing cache size) we
can see a steady decrease in the fault rate. In fact, it has a very linear slope.
Which means that we slowly approach a 0% fault rate the closer we get to the length
of the file.
